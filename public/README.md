My personal website. Easily modifiable, and built using modern javascript with Node.js, React, Express, React-Router, Hot Module Reloading, Webpack and many other technologies.
The master branch of this repository contains a simplified version of my website intended for serverless hosting on github pages. 

This branch is auto generated and to check the code please navigate to the `dev` branch, the main reason behind this is a restriction on github pages that allows only rendering form the master branch when the repository setup under this name format. `github.io`

Cheers,
Elias

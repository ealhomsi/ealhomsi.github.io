#### Intro

So, My name is Elias and could be nicknamed Eli or Mr. E. I am originally from Syria and I have lived in both Lebanon and Canada.
I like sports: hiking, swimming and running. I also like playing video games like Dota 2 and World of Warcraft.
<br><br>

I am an undergraduate software engineer student at [McGill](https://mcgill.ca) where I am studying towards my engineering degree. My primary goal is to graduate as soon as I can :P. I am also considering following my passion in doing a master's degree in Math (Number Theory).
<br><br>

Although interrested in academia and reasearch, I am a strong believer of gaining experience through practice. Through internships, I learned that studying SE in school and practicing it in industry are two different things. I am looking for exciting projects and good people to work with (full time or internship).

#### Currently
At Microsoft, I am working with the Location services team. I have learned how to work within teams, build relationships, and balance between work and life.
